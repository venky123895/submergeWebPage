            <h1>Nikhil Chinapa</h1>
            <p>To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his career, is like saying it snows in Alaska; a bit of an understatement. He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival Director —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.<br>

                He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital Design. A year later and for reasons that scientists are still trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV.<br> He said, “I think it’ll be fun.” For once, he was right.<br>
                
                At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired. <br>From MTV Select – MTV’s longest running show, (it aired continuously for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on Roadies as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.
                
                Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real job.</p>
